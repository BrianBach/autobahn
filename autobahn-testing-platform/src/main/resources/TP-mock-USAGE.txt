Use server.sh script to launch multiple instances of Mock Technology Proxy.

Example:

server.sh 1 8080

Launches 1 instance of TechnologyProxy listening on port 8080.
URLs of TP service is:
http://localhost:8080/autobahn/tool1
You may program the behaviour of TP remotely to simulate a network problem. URL is:
http://localhost:8080/autobahn/programmer1

Example2:
server.sh 3 9090

Launches 3 instances of TechnologyProxy listening on port 9090.

URLs of TP services are:
http://localhost:9090/autobahn/tool1
http://localhost:9090/autobahn/tool2
http://localhost:9090/autobahn/tool3

You may program the behaviour of TP remotely to simulate a network problem. URLs are:
http://localhost:9090/autobahn/programmer1
http://localhost:9090/autobahn/programmer2
http://localhost:9090/autobahn/programmer3


All the incoming requests and operations are displayed on console.
-----------------------------

Programming mock tool:
Launch client.sh script to program desired TP instance.
Example:
client.sh http://localhost:8082/autobahn/programmer1 REQ_EX 20

Tells the TP instance (programmer1 controls tool1) to throw REQuest_EXception after 20 seconds after addReservation method was called for the TP.

Valid messages are:
OK - success
REQ_EX - RequestException
SYS_EX - SystemException
